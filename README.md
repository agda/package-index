Nowadays, if you want to make available your library, it's easy but
you must to make a PR following the structure showed for instance
in the folder `src/agda-prop` or `src/standard-library`.

In the future, we'll provide an integration with Github to make
all this process automatically. This Github bot is already [working in progress](https://github.com/jonaprieto/agda-pkg-server).
